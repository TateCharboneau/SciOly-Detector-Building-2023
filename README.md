# Project Overview

## 2023: Mass Measurement Detector
In this project, I built a device capable of measuring mass using fundamental electronic components and an Arduino for data processing. The system was designed to convert weight into an electrical signal, which was processed and displayed through the Arduino.

# Features:
- Measurement of mass using basic electrical components (resistors, capacitors, etc.)
- Arduino-based signal processing and data output
- CAD files for custom sensor housing and component layout

# Files Included:
- mass_detector.ino: Arduino code for processing electrical signals and converting them to mass values.
- cad_files/: Folder containing CAD files for the custom sensor housing and component layout.


# Project Goals
- Apply fundamental electronics and computer science skills to build functional devices.
- Combine hardware design and software programming to solve real-world measurement challenges.
- Demonstrate the use of mathematical and physical principles in creating detectors for practical applications.
