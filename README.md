# Project Overview

## 2023: Mass Measurement Detector
This project focuses on measuring mass using fundamental electronic components and an Arduino for data processing. The system is designed to convert weight into an electrical signal, which is processed and displayed through the Arduino.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a rudimentary version of the code that I used in the actual competition. This is designed to give you a foundation for the event, not complete the project for you :P

# Features:
- Measurement of mass using basic electrical components (resistors, capacitors, force-sensitive resistors, etc.)
- Arduino-based signal processing and data output
- CAD files for custom sensor housing and component layout

# Files Included:
- mass_detector.ino: Arduino code for processing electrical signals and converting them to mass values.
- CAD files for the custom sensor housing and component layout.

# Project Goals
- Apply fundamental electronics and computer science skills to build functional devices.
- Combine hardware design and software programming to solve real-world measurement challenges.
- Demonstrate the use of mathematical and physical principles in creating detectors for practical applications.

# How to Run the Code:
- Download the .ino file
- Open the file in the Arduino IDE.
- Connect your Arduino to your computer and upload the code.
- Follow the wiring instructions provided in the source code comments to set up the electronics.
- Run the system and observe the output in the Serial Monitor or LCD display.
- (NOTE: not every wiring path is commented, part of the challenge is figuring out what the code means and how to implement certain parts)
